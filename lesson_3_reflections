When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are sharing a project with others, if you want to share code and get input/suggestions from others, or if 
you are working from multiple computers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe if someone else makes a change to github you don't necessary want to pull that to your local folder?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are very similar to cloning but it's completely on GitHub. You can fork someone's repository to make a 
copy onto your own github page and then edit it. Clones are copies from github 
repositories onto your local computer. Branches are just new branches within your local github repository.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So you know when you last pushed to your github repository? You know how far ahead you are in your local repository.
