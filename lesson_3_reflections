When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are sharing a project with others, if you want to share code and get input/suggestions from others, or if 
you are working from multiple computers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe if someone else makes a change to github you don't necessary want to pull that to your local folder?
