What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository using git init it makes a new folder called .git

This will start tracking all of your file history/versions. If you don't do this it's not a
git repository it's just a regular folder. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where you place/hold files that you want to commit. It's different from the working directory 
because it's a subset of the working directory. It's also a subset of the repository. It allows you to place files that have been updated there and commit some/multiple files at once.
